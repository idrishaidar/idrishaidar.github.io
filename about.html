I'm a Data Scientist. I graduated from Computer Science Faculty at <a href="https://cs.ui.ac.id/">University of Indonesia</a>. I met the love of my life there.
<br><br>
I'm teaching Data Science and Machine Learning at <a href="https://purwadhika.com/">Purwadhika</a>. I enjoy learning data stuffs with others. Teaching is one of my favorite learning methods.
<br><br>
Previously, I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst at <a href="https://kitabisa.com/">Kitabisa</a> and a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.airy.com/">Airy</a>. I met cool data guys and did cool projects at these places. Some of them (both the people and the projects) inspire me to write this site.
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>assembling IKEA's furnitures</li>
    <li>washing my car</li>
    <li>changing my bike's oil</li>
    <li>red-switched mechanical keyboard</li>
