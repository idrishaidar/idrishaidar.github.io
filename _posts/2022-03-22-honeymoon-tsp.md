My wife and I married in 2019. We spent most of our honeymoon visiting several shopping malls near our first residency.

Actually, they are not too near. We lived in a gated community, but it is rather isolated and the surroundings looked like a sub urban area. Our nearest favorite shopping mall takes 30 minute drive. The same for the nearest decent hospital, market, train station, and some other mandatory public facilities. Well, those are what you could expect if you spend only around Rp1mio monthly rent fee for a relatively new house in a gated community.

It's a cool place to live for introverts. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them. I still like visiting public places.

There are more interesting places that I've discovered some time before my first son was born. By the time the pandemic came, I haven't got much opportunity to visit (or revisit) these places until now. 

I would be cool if I could visit all of them at one go.
